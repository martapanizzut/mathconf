**Francesco Nowell (TU Berlin) - Polyhedral Geometry of Max-Linear Conditional Independence**

The conditional independence (CI) relation of a distribution in a max-linear Bayesian network is fully determined by the combinatorics of critical paths in the underlying weighted graph. We call these CI structures maxoids, and prove that every maxoid can be obtained from a transitively closed weighted DAG. We show that the stratification of generic weight matrices by their maxoids yields a polyhedral fan which is the normal fan of the Minkowski sum of the Newton polytopes of path polynomials in the graph. The derived constructions and results form the basis for computational approaches to problems of enumeration and conditional independence implication.

**Ayush Kumar Tewari (RICAM, Linz) - On the Genus of One Degree of Freedom Planar Linkages via Tropical Geometry**

We focus on studying the configuration spaces of graphs realised in \mathbb{C}^{2}, such that
the configuration space is, after normalisation, one dimensional. If this is the case, then the
configuration space is, generically, a smooth complex curve, and can be seen as a Riemann
surface. The property of interest is the genus of this curve. Using tropical geometry,
we give an algorithm to compute this genus. Using an implementation in Python we give
various examples. (based on joint work with Josef Schicho and Audie Warren)
