**Ansgar Freyer (FU Berlin) - Bounds on the lattice width of convex bodies with few interior points**

The classical flatness theorem states that the lattice width of a convex body without interior lattice points is bounded by a constant depending only on the dimension. Similarly, a convex body with volume at most 1 is known to have bounded lattice width. Our goal is to bridge these two problems by studying bounds on the lattice width of convex bodies with a bounded, but positive, number of interior lattice points. While there are good asymptotic bounds available, there is little knowledge about the exact values of the upper bounds in such problems. In the plane, the flatness problem was fully settled by Hurkens, while Makai and Fejes Toth solved the volumetric problem. We show that the lattice width of a planar convex body with at most one interior lattice point is uniquely maximized by the third dilate of an empty lattice triangle. As a corollary, we obtain an isominwidth inequality for the lattice point enumerator. That is, among convex bodies that contain the origin in their interior, the ratio w^2 / i, where w is the lattice width and i is the number of interior points, is maximized by the third dilate of an empty triangle. This is joint work with Gennadiy Averkov, Giulia Codenotti and Kyle Huang.


**Kyle Huang (BTU Cottbus) - UniTriSat: Unimodular triangulations via SATISFIABILITY**
Abstract: Given a lattice polytope, it is natural to ask if it has a unimodular triangulation. Unimodular triangulations have connections to toric geometry, tropical geometry, and enumerative combinatorics, while also being an interesting property in their own right, for various classes of lattice polytopes. With the Julia package UniTriSat, we present a new algorithm for computing unimodular triangulations and regular unimodular triangulations, via translation to a SATISFIABILITY problem. A QuickStart guide can be found at [github.com/krhuang/UniTriSat](github.com/krhuang/UniTriSat). 



**Francesco Nowell (TU Berlin) - Polyhedral Geometry of Max-Linear Conditional Independence**

The conditional independence (CI) relation of a distribution in a max-linear Bayesian network is fully determined by the combinatorics of critical paths in the underlying weighted graph. We call these CI structures maxoids, and prove that every maxoid can be obtained from a transitively closed weighted DAG. We show that the stratification of generic weight matrices by their maxoids yields a polyhedral fan which is the normal fan of the Minkowski sum of the Newton polytopes of path polynomials in the graph. The derived constructions and results form the basis for computational approaches to problems of enumeration and conditional independence implication.

**Diego A. Robayo Bargans (RPTU Kaiserslautern) - Enumeration of geometric Weierstrass points of metric graphs**

A classical result states that on a smooth algebraic curve of genus $g$ the number of Weierstrass points, counted with multiplicity, is g^3-g. We use tropical covers to introduce the notion of geometric Weierstrass points of metric graphs and show that a generic metric graph of genus g has g^3-g geometric Weierstrass points counted with multiplicity. The employed methods also provide a new proof of the existence of Weierstrass points on metric graphs of genus bigger than or equal to 2. 


**Ayush Kumar Tewari (RICAM, Linz) - On the Genus of One Degree of Freedom Planar Linkages via Tropical Geometry**

We focus on studying the configuration spaces of graphs realised in C^2, such that
the configuration space is, after normalisation, one dimensional. If this is the case, then the
configuration space is, generically, a smooth complex curve, and can be seen as a Riemann
surface. The property of interest is the genus of this curve. Using tropical geometry,
we give an algorithm to compute this genus. Using an implementation in Python we give
various examples. (based on joint work with Josef Schicho and Audie Warren)
